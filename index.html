  <p2>Having worked in multiple sales roles such as retail sales at Fido, hunter role at SHiFT Connect,
    and territory management at ImpresPharma, it has provided me with the skills to be a comprehensive
    sales professional. The type of work that I am most interested in is one that I can provide the most
    impact and bring the most value to and cultivate strong long-term relationships with current and future
    customers. What I am looking for in my next company is a synergic relationship where I can drive growth to
    the company while developing my career.</p2>
